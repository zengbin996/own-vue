									If you can't be a pine on the top of the hill,
									Be a scrub in the valley - but be
									The best little scrub by the side of the rill;
									Be a bush, if you can't be a tree.　

									If you can't be a bush, be a bit of the grass,
									And some highway happier make;
									If you can't be a muskie, then just be a bass -
									But the liveliest bass in the lake!
